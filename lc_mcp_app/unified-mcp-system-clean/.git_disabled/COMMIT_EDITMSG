feat: implement rock-solid production hardening

Final GPT-5 improvements for enterprise deployment:

- Docker Compose security hardening:
  * Read-only filesystem with tmpfs for /tmp
  * Explicit write volumes only where needed (/app/data, /app/logs)
  * All services run as non-root (10001:10001)
  * Full capability dropping and security options

- Prometheus configuration:
  * Proper job names (mcp_server, lc_mcp_app)
  * Correct service discovery for Docker network
  * Optimized scrape intervals

- MCP specification compliance:
  * Add tests/mcp_contract/test_spec.py for contract validation
  * JSON Schema validation for all tools
  * Safe tool execution testing

- Enhanced smoke testing:
  * Comprehensive endpoint coverage
  * Function calling validation
  * Health and metrics verification

System is now rock-solid and ready for production deployment.
