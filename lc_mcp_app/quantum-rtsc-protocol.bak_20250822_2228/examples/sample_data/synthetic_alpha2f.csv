# Synthetic α²F(ω) spectrum for RTSC protocol testing
# This represents an idealized hydrogenated graphene spectrum with:
# - Strong hydrogen vibron peak at ~150 meV
# - Moderate plasmon contribution at ~80 meV  
# - Weak low-frequency acoustic modes
# - High f_ω ratio for spectral weight enhancement
#
# Generated parameters:
# ω_log ≈ 142 meV, λ_total ≈ 2.6, f_ω ≈ 1.4
